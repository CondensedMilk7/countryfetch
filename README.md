# Countryfetch

A cli tool for fetching information about countries. A Go alternative to my original
[countryfetch](https://github.com/CondensedMilk7/countryfetch) which is written in TypeScript (Deno).

This is a work in progress.

## To do:

- Colored output
- Better error handling
- Search country by capital name
- Flag ASCII art (like in the original)
